# Welcome!

In this website you will find details about [academic projects](/projects/) and [policy work](policy).

I am currently a Research Fellow at InSIS, University of Oxford, and I teach International Political Economy at El Colegio de México.

I hold a doctoral degree from the Blavatnik School of Government, University of Oxford. Previously I studied at the University of Chicago, Tsinghua University and El Colegio de México in programas on international politics and policy. But my work equally benefits from my years working for the Mexican government, international NGOs, and as a consultant to international organization on climate and energy policy.

Feel free to contact me via email or social media, specially if you want a publication that is not available online.


**How to refer to my name**
<br />
My full name is Jose Maria Valenzuela Robles Linares. You'll find that my work authored in English only includes my first name "Jose Maria" and the first part of my last name "Valenzuela".

So academic references should refer to "Valenzuela, Jose Maria" or sometimes "Valenzuela Robles Linares, José María". Just avoid using Linares as my single last name.
