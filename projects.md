# Governance of carbon neutrality and GHG removal
------------

<p align="justify"> I work wit the project GGR: Governance and standards for carbon neutrality (<a href="https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk/gascon-ggrs-governance-and-standards-carbon-neutrality">Gascon</a>).Our objective is to devise principles for GGR governance that are adapted to the specific conditions and constraints of individual countries, and are in line with UN climate and sustainable development goals. Government and civil society actors have very different views on the role GGR should play, if any, in efforts to tackle climate change. Countries and communities are also likely to be differentially affected by their deployment, and will bear different risk burdens and/or local development opportunities in pursuit of a global public good.  Our work will examine locally appropriate incentives and regulations. </p>

# Comparative politics of energy and decarbonisation
-----------
<p align="justify"> My work on the politics of energy and decarbonisation started a decade ago and has increasingly focused on the electricity sector. Including, for example working with the Oxford Martin Programme on Integrating Renewable Energy. This work includes comparative research on the governance of the electricity industry beyond the focus on market reforms. My doctoral research shows the relevance of non-market actors (like research institutions) to explain the success on advancing the energy transition agenda.</p>

<p align="justify"> While I prepare my doctoral findings for publication, you can see early findings in these two recordings:</p> <br />

# Global Governance of climate-related financial risk
------------
<p An emerging subject in global governance is the analysis and disclosure of climate-related risk. The most public feature of the emerging regime is the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) created in 2015. I am interested in the three dimensions. First, the standardisation of risk depiction and analysis through private and public rule and practice making. Second, the paths of international difussion through markets and public regulators coordination. And, finally, the use of scenarios which, I believe, should be subjected to continuous public contestation. I hope to publish my findings on the three dimensions between 2021 and 2022. </p>
