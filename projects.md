# Governance of carbon neutrality and GHG removal
------------

<p align="justify"> I work wit the project GGR: Governance and standards for carbon neutrality (<a href="https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk/gascon-ggrs-governance-and-standards-carbon-neutrality">Gascon</a>).Our objective is to devise principles for GGR governance that are adapted to the specific conditions and constraints of individual countries, and are in line with UN climate and sustainable development goals. Government and civil society actors have very different views on the role GGR should play, if any, in efforts to tackle climate change. Countries and communities are also likely to be differentially affected by their deployment, and will bear different risk burdens and/or local development opportunities in pursuit of a global public good.  Our work will examine locally appropriate incentives and regulations. </p>
