<p align="justify"> I'm a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute for Science, Innovation and Society (<a href="https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk/">InSIS</a>) at the University of Oxford. I am also active member of the Oxford Martin Programme on Integrating Renewable Energy y the Energy Programme at El Colegio de México. I work on the intersection of global governance and the politics of knowledge and state capacity. </p>

<p align="justify">  I'm part of the research team for the project GGR: Governance and standards for carbon neutrality (<a href="https://www.insis.ox.ac.uk/gascon-ggrs-governance-and-standards-carbon-neutrality">Gascon</a>). I also collaborate regularly with the Oxford Net Zero Initiative and the Oxford Scenarios Programme at Saïd Business School.</p>

<p align="justify"> Before joining academia I worked for the Ministry of Energy of Mexico in charge of climate policy for the energy sector and on renewable energy planning. I also worked for WWF Mexico and consulted for the US National Renewable Energy Lab, UNIDO, and UNEP. </p>
