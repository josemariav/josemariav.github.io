**Climate ambition beyond emissions numbers**

The french think thank IDDRI released the report "Climate ambition beyond emission number -Taking stock of progress by looking inside countries and sector". I co-authored with Daniel Buira the section on Mexico.

We argue that Mexico's slow climate action derives from the weight of the ocurrence of a one-in-a-generation energy reform that essentially relegated climate ambition, both already reflected in domestic environmental laws but also the increasing evidence of urgency of action. In particuar Mexico faces a challenge of over-committment to natural gas infraestructure. Reverting this very recent lock-in in electricity, in addition to the pre-existing relying of fossil fuel for transport, will require signficant political, financial and managerial effort.

In a country divided between different views of the role of the state in the economy, it is essential to build political roadmaps of decarbonisation that work for an state-dominated energy industry, as well as one that is liberalised.
